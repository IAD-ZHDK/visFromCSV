# Simple CSV to visualisation example

This example demonstrates data being read from a CSV file and visualised in p5js. 

The data in the CSV file is based on fish movement gathered from a CV model and is provided by the Jordan research group at the [Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior](https://www.ab.mpg.de/jordan).
